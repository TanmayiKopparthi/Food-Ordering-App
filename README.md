# Food-Ordering-App
Project Overview: Food Ordering System (Incremental Model)
1. Introduction
The Food Ordering System is a web-based application designed to allow users to browse menus, place orders, and make payments online. It follows the Incremental Software Development Model, where the system is built in phases, adding functionalities gradually.
2. Incremental Model Approach
The Incremental Model develops the system in small, manageable increments, where each increment adds new features. Each version undergoes planning, development, testing, and deployment before moving to the next.
3. Incremental Phases & Features
ðŸŸ¢ Increment 1: Basic Ordering System
âœ… User can view the menu.
âœ… User can select items and add them to a cart.
âœ… Basic frontend UI (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
âœ… Static menu without backend integration.

ðŸŸ¢ Increment 2: User Authentication & Database
âœ… User Registration & Login (via email/password).
âœ… Database setup (MySQL / MongoDB) to store users and orders.
âœ… Basic backend using Node.js & Express.js.

ðŸŸ¢ Increment 3: Order Processing & Payment
âœ… Users can place orders & view order history.
âœ… Payment gateway integration (Stripe / PayPal).
âœ… Backend validation for order processing.
âœ… Admin panel for order management.

ðŸŸ¢ Increment 4: Real-time Order Tracking & Notifications
âœ… Real-time order status updates (Processing, Out for Delivery, Delivered).
âœ… Email / SMS notifications for order confirmation.
âœ… WebSocket integration for live tracking.

ðŸŸ¢ Increment 5: Reviews, Ratings & Discounts
âœ… Users can leave reviews and rate food items.
âœ… Admin can add promotional discounts & offers.
âœ… Recommendation system for personalized food suggestions.

4. Deployment Approach
Incremental Releases: Each phase is deployed separately.
Testing: Each increment undergoes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD): Automated deployment via GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

5. Maintenance & Security Updates
Bug Fixes: Regular patches for UI/UX issues and performance improvements.
Security Patches: Protection against SQL injection, CSRF, XSS attacks.
Feature Enhancements: Adding new functionalities based on user feedback.

6. Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB / MySQL
Authentication: JWT, OAuth
Payment Integration: Stripe, PayPal
Hosting: AWS, Firebase, Netlify

Conclusion
The incremental model ensures a structured development approach where core functionalities are built first, followed by advanced features. This minimizes risk and allows early user feedback for continuous improvement. ðŸš€
